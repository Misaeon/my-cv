  author  = {Miao*, Sen and Gangolells, Marta and Tejedor, Blanca},
  abstract = {CO2-based ventilation rate estimation techniques have been widely used in relevant studies in naturally ventilated educational buildings. Such techniques are non-invasive, low-cost, simple, accurate, and do not interfere with the activities of indoor occupants. However, the estimation is significantly affected by the CO2 measurement noise, the uncertainties associated with CO2 generation rate, and complex natural ventilation dynamics. Existing techniques were found to have limited capabilities to deal with these aspects. Therefore, this research proposed an adaptive particle filter algorithm for CO2-based natural ventilation rate estimation and validated it through a case study in an educational building. Compared with the existing transient mass balance model and the extended Kalman filter technique, the estimation stability has been improved by nearly 6 times and 3 times, respectively. More importantly, the proposed algorithm is significantly more robust to abrupt changes in indoor CO2 and can effectively avoid large drifts in the estimated ventilation rate due to sudden window opening and sudden changes in room occupancy, demonstrating great practical applicability for real-time estimation with a high temporal resolution of 1 minute. To help relevant users with practical applications, the study also analyzed the algorithm parameter settings and the impact of simplification strategies commonly used in relevant studies, such as the use of a fixed outdoor CO2 concentration, an averaged CO2 generation rate, and an assumed constant room occupancy. Finally, considering that applying the proposed algorithm requires programming skills, an open, user-friendly software has been developed for relevant users for a convenient implementation.},

  title     = {Data-driven model for predicting indoor air quality and thermal comfort levels in naturally ventilated educational buildings using easily accessible data for schools},
  author    = {Miao*, Sen and Gangolells, Marta and Tejedor, Blanca},
  abstract  = {Modeling indoor air quality and thermal conditions in educational buildings is significant for protecting students' health, well-being, and productivity. The predictive models in existing studies were mainly built and applied in controlled environments with HVAC systems. These models did not involve occupant-related factors, had limited scope in a single building or space, and required indoor environmental monitoring data for the model input. This limits the applicability and generalization ability of the model in a large number of schools relying on natural ventilation, where indoor air quality and thermal conditions are significantly affected by occupants’ activities and ventilation practices. Hence, this paper proposes a methodology to develop a data-driven model for predicting the level of indoor air quality and thermal comfort in naturally ventilated educational buildings, and identifies the key influential factors. The model was developed using the class-weighted random forest algorithm with data collected from a large measurement campaign. The developed model demonstrated good accuracy, generalization ability, and robustness. The analysis concluded that occupancy, windows and doors operation, and outdoor environmental parameters are key factors must be involved, whereas building characteristics have no practical contribution to the prediction. The model inputs are easily accessible data for schools. Once the model is developed with data collected from an initial measurement campaign in representative educational buildings, it can be used in all local schools without requiring monitoring sensor networks, thereby rendering a “cost-effective” way of assessing indoor air quality and thermal comfort to help relevant stakeholders improve building management practices in schools.},

  author    = {Miao*, Sen and Gangolells, Marta and Tejedor, Blanca},
  abstract = {Maintaining good indoor air quality and thermal comfort is a challenge for naturally ventilated educational buildings, as it can be difficult to achieve both aspects simultaneously. Nonetheless, most of the existing studies only focus on one aspect. To explore the potential of balancing indoor air quality and thermal comfort, both topics must be investigated concurrently. This study assessed indoor air quality and thermal comfort in 32 naturally ventilated classrooms of 16 primary and secondary schools in the Mediterranean climate, based on a large on-site measurement campaign lasting one year that gathered over 460 hours of data. The research investigated occupants’ adaptive behaviors, analyzed the actual thermal comfort of around 600 students, and characterized the representative scenarios leading to good and poor indoor air quality and thermal comfort by clustering analysis. The results showed that poor indoor air quality was mainly due to closing windows and doors in winter, while thermal discomfort mainly occurred in summer because of the high indoor temperature. The findings suggested that a proper ventilation protocol is the key to balancing indoor air quality and thermal comfort.},
