  author  = {Miao, Sen and Gangolells, Marta and Tejedor, Blanca},
  abstract = {CO2-based ventilation rate estimation techniques have been widely used in naturally ventilated educational buildings. However, estimation accuracy is strongly affected by CO2 measurement noise, uncertainties in CO2 generation rate, and complex natural ventilation dynamics. This study proposes an adaptive particle filter algorithm for CO2-based natural ventilation rate estimation and validates it through a real educational building case study. Compared with the transient mass balance model and extended Kalman filter, estimation stability improves by nearly 6 and 3 times, respectively. The algorithm is robust to abrupt CO2 variations caused by window opening or occupancy changes and enables real-time estimation with a temporal resolution of 1 minute.},

  abstract          = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
