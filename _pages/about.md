I am a **Marie Curie** postdoc fellow at [Building Services Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/ace/organisation/building-services-engineering/).

As a big fan of **Statistical Inference** and **Machine Learning**, my research focuses on **Building Informatics** and **Indoor Environmental Quality**, with particular interests in:

i) Analyzing key factors influencing indoor environmental quality and occupants’ perceptions;

ii) Modeling human–building interactions under system uncertainties; 

iii) Developing advanced predictive models and control algorithms for intelligent building management.
